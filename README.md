# Now Is The Time

Now is the time for all good humans

Now is the time for all good humans to come to the aid of our Mother, Earth.

Before it is too late, we will harness rnewables efficiently, make machines for humanity instead of war, and learn how to live in symbiosis with our planet and beyond.

We have the technology, but at this day in time it does not matter. Resources are limited due to the operation of the system. 

Thank you!
